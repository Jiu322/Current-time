# Real-Time Clock Display Page

This is a minimalistic real-time clock display page that automatically updates the current time every second.

## Features

- Automatic real-time time update (refreshes every second)
- Responsive layout compatible with various devices
- Clean, modern visual design
- Implemented using native JavaScript with no external dependencies

## Page Structure

- **Time Display**: Shows the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format centered on the page
- **Adaptive Font Size**: Font size automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Dark Theme Design**: Black text on a white background for high readability

## Technical Implementation

- Built with HTML5 structure
- CSS Flexbox layout for centering content
- JavaScript for time retrieval and automatic updates
- Uses the `padStart` method to ensure consistent time formatting
- Employs `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for precise second-level updates

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser
2. The page will automatically display and update the current time in real time

This project is ideal as a simple web clock implementation or as an example for learning fundamental HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts.
